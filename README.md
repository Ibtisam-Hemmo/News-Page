# News-Page
Simple News App to demostarte my skills in vanilla JavaScript and Using LocalStorage.

## Project content:
The project contains many pages using (HTML , CSS AND JS ), Main page for displaying news in general and the most important news around the world, one for every topic as tech, economy and politics. The last page for displaying the news in details with image, headline and description.

**Local storage** is used in this project to help keep my **Comment Section** whenever I refresh the page.

- As a user, I need to be able to:<br>
- [x]  visit your site and immediately see the most important news in a special section.<br>
- [x] visit your site and see a navigation link for the different page sections.<br>
- [x] see the different news sections and each section should contain its related news (e.g. Politics, Sport, Economy, Tech ...etc ).<br>
- [x] see a separate section aside from the page, that contains the most read articles.<br> 
- [x] see a separate page that contains the news details (a photo, text description) and any related news.<br> 
- [x] be able to add my opinion about the news, which will be added to the list of others opinions. :partying_face:<br>
